Problem Statement: Explain the importance of engaging patients early on and helping them identify symptoms accurately before a doctor visit.
Objective: Build a chatbot that assists patients in assessing their symptoms, identifying possible conditions, and recommending treatments or consultations.
Technical Stack Overview:
Backend: Flask (Python) for API and chatbot logic.
Database: CSV files for storing symptoms, conditions, treatments, doctors, and appointments.
Natural Language Processing: NLTK (Python library) for tokenization and stop-word removal to analyze patient input.
Frontend: Basic HTML for the UI.
Deployment: The app can be deployed on local servers (or cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS).
Workflow of the Chatbot:
The flow of interaction from the user's perspective:

User Input: The patient (user) interacts with the chatbot interface by typing their symptoms.
Symptom Matching: The chatbot processes the input and matches the symptoms with a predefined set of conditions.
Ask for Duration: The bot will then ask how long the user has been experiencing these symptoms to provide better recommendations.
Recommendation: Based on the symptoms and duration, the bot either:
Suggests at-home remedies if symptoms are mild.
Recommends consulting a doctor for severe or persistent symptoms.
Appointment Booking: The chatbot offers an option to book an appointment with a doctor if needed.
User Feedback: After the conversation, the bot can collect feedback for improvement.
2. Workflow Algorithm:
Steps to follow:
User Interaction Initialization:

User enters the platform: The chatbot asks for the userâ€™s name.
Response: The bot greets the user and stores the name for personalized interaction.
Symptom Matching:

Ask for symptoms: The bot asks the user about their symptoms.
Symptom Detection: The input is processed using the match_symptoms() function to detect common symptoms.
Symptoms list: The chatbot then compiles all the symptoms mentioned.
Duration of Symptoms:

Ask about duration: The chatbot asks the user how long they have been experiencing symptoms.
Response Processing: If the duration is 5 days or more, the chatbot may recommend seeing a doctor; if less than 5 days, it advises monitoring.
Condition Identification:

Identify possible conditions: Based on matched symptoms, the bot determines a potential condition.
Treatment Recommendation: Once the condition is identified, the bot provides a treatment recommendation.
Doctor Appointment Booking:

Ask for doctor consultation: If the symptoms require further consultation, the bot will offer to book an appointment.
Check availability: The bot checks available time slots and offers a choice.
Book Appointment: The bot then confirms the appointment and assigns a doctor from the list.
